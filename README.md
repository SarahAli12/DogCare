## Age/Stages of Life
- Puppy
- Teenager
- Adult
- Elder
  - can’t train anymore
  - more prone to illness

## Statistics
Each are out of 100.
- Health Bar
  - hunger (25 / 100)
  - thirst (25 / 100)
  - the other 50% is full unless they're ill
- Happiness Bar
- Hygiene Bar
- Relationship (with owner)
- Intelligence (pre-determined at start from 0% - 25%)

## Actions
We should make it more complicated, with actions affecting more than 1 bar.
- Play (affects happiness)
  - fetch (+40)
  - chewing toy (+30)
  - treat (+10)
- Groom (affects hygiene)
  - brush (+30)
  - bathe (+40)

  - food (+10)
  - water (+10)
- Affection (affects relationship)
  - belly rub (+40)
  - ear scratch (+20)
  - cuddle (+40)
- Train (affects intelligence)
  - pre-determined intelligence between 0 and 25
  - sit (+25)
  - roll over (+25)
  - play dead (+25)
  - more likely to succeed if relationship is good
- Take to vet
  - display “your dog is healthy” message if they have no illness
- Age
  - automatically when all bars are full

## Consequential Happenings
- Malnutrition
- Dehydration
- Depression
- Disconnect from owner
- Complaint from others over behaviour

## Random Happenings
- Illness
  - rabies
  - pneumonia
  - vomiting
  - fever
  - cough
  - fleas (not really an illness but whatever)
- Attack by another dog
- Splashes in puddle → covered in mud
- Kidnapping (maybe not? cus what would you even do? that’s it for your dog, game over)
  - maybe add a random option to get them back?
- Losing your dog

## Dog Pic Sizing
- Beagle
  - puppy: 150 px high
  - teen: 200 px high
  - adult+elder: 250 px high
  - actions: all the actions will be default for the adult and resized later, so about 250 px high, but use your judgement to determine height e.g. lower when laying down, higher when jumping (but we're done most of them anyways)
- Golden
  - goldens are bigger than beagles, so I think just make it about 100 px taller? e.g. 200, 250, 300
  - again, use your judgement to determine action pic sizing, try to keep the same ratio as with beagles
